1. Selenium IDE : Integrated devlopment environment
==================================================
It can downloaded on chrome browser as an extension
https://www.selenium.dev/selenium-ide/

Features:
==============================
It supports testing on Chrome and firefox browser
It is record and playback tool
It records users actions and you save that as a test
Play it back as many times as you want
Simple and easy to work with
The log section will show test step is success or failure
At the end in log you will get test executed successfully or it failed
Suitable for testers w
ho are new automation
Who donot know how to write code

============================
Disadvantages:

Every time the test case will run with same test data
passing multiple test data is not possible with IDE
Everytime any new test case we have to manually record
We dont have advance features like:

> Wait times
> Paramterized testing
> Data driven not allowed
> No reports are generated
> no scheduling of scripts 
> pritoritze test cases
> pre-condition, post condition
=================================================

2. Selenium WebDriver
==================================================
Selenium Webdriver is the main component of Selenium- where we will do exhaustive automation testing.
This component has to user interface rather it has selenium libraries which needs to be added in your eclipse
Usinng webdriver libraries you will selenium scripts
Every programming lanaguge supported by selenium will have its corresponding selenium webdriver libraries

Selenium webdriver provides interfaces, classes and methods that help us find the element to be tested and automatically perform as action
 What ever we did in IDE manually, we will do via code in webdriver

Features:
==================
> supports testing on all browser
> Wait times
> Paramterized testing
Integrate Webdriver with tools like testNG and cucumber that enhances the fetaures of selenium webdriver
> Data driven testing
> pritoritze test cases
> pre-condition, post condition
> reports generation

Because of W3C prootocal with Selenium 4:

> tets cases run faster as there is no need to Encode or decode the scripts
> Testing is more consistent and works better on croass browser
> browser specific exception --> now we dont get those with selenium 4
>No need to download drivers in the system --> webDriver Manager -> it will automatically download each driver and works with all browser


3. Selenium GRID
=======================

Grid is that component of selenium which is used only for execution

We dont write sscripts using grid

If you want to execute test cases in distributed environment-> use grid
